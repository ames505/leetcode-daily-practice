I'll explain this `removeElement` function step by step:

### Purpose of the Function
This function removes all occurrences of a specific value (`val`) from an array (`nums`) and returns the number of elements remaining after removal.

### Function Parameters
- `nums`: An array of numbers
- `val`: The value to remove from the array

### How the Function Works

1. **Initialize a Counter**: 
   ```javascript
   let k = 0;
   ```
   - `k` tracks the position where we should place elements we want to keep
   - It also represents the count of elements that will remain after removal

2. **Loop Through the Array**: 
   ```javascript
   for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
   ```
   - We examine each element of the array one by one

3. **Check and Keep Valid Elements**: 
   ```javascript
   if (nums[i] !== val) {
       nums[k] = nums[i];
       k++;
   }
   ```
   - If the current element is NOT equal to the value we want to remove:
     - Copy it to position `k` in the array (which may be the same position or an earlier position)
     - Increment `k` to prepare for the next element we want to keep

4. **Return the Count**: 
   ```javascript
   return k;
   ```
   - `k` now represents how many elements remain in the array after removing all instances of `val`

### Visual Example

Let's say we have:
- `nums = [3, 2, 2, 3]`
- `val = 3`

Step by step:
1. Initialize `k = 0`
2. Loop through the array:
   - `i = 0`: `nums[0] = 3`, which equals `val`, so skip
   - `i = 1`: `nums[1] = 2`, which is not `val`, so `nums[0] = 2`, increment `k` to 1
   - `i = 2`: `nums[2] = 2`, which is not `val`, so `nums[1] = 2`, increment `k` to 2
   - `i = 3`: `nums[3] = 3`, which equals `val`, so skip
3. Return `k = 2`

The array is now effectively `[2, 2, ?, ?]` where the first 2 elements are the ones we want to keep.

### Key Insight

This algorithm uses a two-pointer technique:
- `i` scans through all elements
- `k` only advances when we find elements to keep
- The function modifies the array in-place without using extra space
- The first `k` elements of the array will contain all elements not equal to `val`

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the array, as we make a single pass through the array.
